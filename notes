 Question 1 


I want to contract appeared with player because contract belongs to player. Thats why I wrote this code 
but it did not work and i got error 



class ContractsController < ApplicationController
    before_action :set_player
    
    
    def index 
        @contract = @player.contracts
        render json: @contracts  
        
    end 


    def show 
      @contract = Contract.find(params[:id])
      render json: @contracts
    #   @player.contracts.find_by(id: params[:id])
    end 
    
    
    def create 
        @contract = @player.contracts.new(contract_params)
         render json: @contracts
    end 
    
   

    def destroy 
       
    end 

    private 
     def set_player
        @player = Player.find(params[:player_id])

     end


    def contract_params 
    params.require(:contract).permit(:start_date, :expiration_date, :amount, :player_id, :team_id)
    end 
end
